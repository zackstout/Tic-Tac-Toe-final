# Tic Tac Toe with Socket.io
Learning Socket.io by making a real-time 1-v-1 game.

## Built With:
- Socket.io
- jQuery

## Stretch Goals
- Figure out why the client sometimes loses all the data if you refresh server without opening new browser.
- Figure out why we can't seem to source in client.js in the normal way and had to cram everything into the ```index.html```.
